# Arduino-Projects
Arduino Projects:  mainly related to robots, remote-controled vehicles, and iot devices. 

obstaceDetection  :   An ultrasound sensor (mounted on a servo) estimates the distance and two IR sensors detect close obstacle

turnServo         :  to manage the rotation of a servo :  for the sonar; and as a basis for a robotic arm. 
We will turn this file into a more elaborate class to more generally manage several servos in order to control the arm. 

inertialSensors   :  to detect collisions, slopes,  and estimate distance via a Kalman filter : NOT DONE YET.
